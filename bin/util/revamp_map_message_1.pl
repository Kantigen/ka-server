my $message = q{Over the past three years the Expanse has seen an explosion of new races seeking assylum from whatever they left behind. We were glad to have new trading partners. However, some of you may have inadvertantly destroyed us all. The Sābēn Demesne were nothing compared to the threat we face now.

Our distant automatic monitoring systems recently intercepted this urgent plea;

*From: The Sābēn Demesne, colony: Accueil Temporaire - (deep space outpost).
To: The Sābēn Demesne Homeworld.

Unknown anomaly detected, thought to be Cosmic String, dragging in and combining with smaller Cosmic Strings, rapidly growing in strength and power.

Our scientist subspecies estimate that within a galactic week this anomaly will reach critical mass and envelope the entire Expanse.

-- Static, screeching, scream's, sounds of distant explosions, plea's for help. --

Homeworld ...we have been impacted by a small cosmic string, massive damage to every building on this outpost. Our Black Hole Generator has gone into critical instability, we are doing all we can to stabilise it but we don't know if we will succeed in time.

-- sounds of a massive explosion, silence.......... --

-- End of intercepted message. --*

It has come to my attention that some of you have been experimenting with singularities through devices you call Black Hole Generators. These technologies are barely within your comprehension, yet you use them as freely as you peel a Beeldeban! These devices are dangerous. I'm sure you've experienced some of their side-effects, but what you do not understand can kill us all. 

A storm approaches. Those of you manipulating these singularities have built up a form of energy on the entire Expanse. It's like the static electricity that's built up on your body when you walk across carpet in wool socks; only in this case, the energy envelops the entire Expanse. When this energy discharges, it could form a cosmic string, ripping a hole in the fabric of space and time itself! 

Stop using these blasted devices now, while we try to sort out how to resolve this mess. 

Your Trading Partner,

Tou Re Ell
