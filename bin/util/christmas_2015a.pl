Ho! Ho! Ho!

It appears that the Christmas spirit has infected %s, the whole planet is so much happier now!

It might just have something to do with that new plan left behind.  Though you may not be able to build it, my elves will keep an eye out for when you're ready.  All you have to do is move the plan to your desired colony, go into the Planetary Command Center's Notes tab, and put the magic word "pyramid31" in, save it, and the next time the elves notice, it will be done!

But, beware the Ides of March - if the plan isn't used by March 15th, it will disappear!  Be sure to use it!
