=head1 Modules vs Buildings

Modules are special types of L<Buildings> that can only be built on a space station.

Modules produce no resources, and therefore may be built to consume resources beyond your production levels.

Modules can only be built, repaired, upgraded, downgraded, and demolished via acts of L<Parliament>. Therefore modules don't inherit the C<build>, C<upgrade>, C<downgrade>, C<demolish>, and C<repair> methods from L<Buildings>.
