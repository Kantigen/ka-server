# Docker-based Configuration File Templates

This directory contains a number of files **example** configuration files for if you were setting up the Keno Antigen server using Docker and Docker Compose. To use, create an `etc` directory and copy all these files into it. These files should be fine to use out of the box, however, if you're feeling brave, you may make changes to these files as they will not appear in the git repository.
