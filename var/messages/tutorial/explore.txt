Above and Beyond

Probes are an excellent way for you to explore the surrounding star systems. You never know what you might find when you send out a probe. Perhaps the best part is they'll continue to transmit information back to you for as long as they remain operational. 

Send out the probe we gave you so you can see what or who may be nearby.
