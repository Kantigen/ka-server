Mission Command
~~~
I've just given you a plan for a Mission Command building. You should build it now.

Mission Command is kind of a like a job board. People all around the expanse have need of certain tasks to be completed, or resources to be acquired. You can help them do that for a profit. Some missions are more interesting than others, and some missions are more profitable than others, but one thing is true: there is no shortage of missions.

At some point you'll likely want to raise your resource production so you can upgrade Mission Command. The higher the level the more jobs are available to you. However, it's a bit too expensive for you to worry about upgrading it just yet. Let's just get it built for now and we can worry about missions later.
