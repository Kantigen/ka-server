# Interface to the PubSub subscription service.
#
# This is currently implemented as a 'fan-out' using beanstalk
# queues. Beanstalk does not offer pub-sub directly so this could
# be considered a bit of a hack.
#
# Look in the future to using something like the RabbitMQ Pub/Sub
# options instead.
#
# Conversely, we have tools in place to monitor and manage beanstalk
# so adding yet another service may just give added complexity
#


#--- Publish
#
#   To publish a message to a channel.
#
#   channel => 'my_channel'
#
#   message =>
#   {
#     route     => 'my/route',
#     content   => {
#       foo => 'bar',
#     }
#   }

#--- Subscribe
#
#   Subscribe to a channel 'my_channel'
#
#   Thereafter any messages to that channel will be
#   forwarded to a unique pipe, e.g. 'my_channel_2'
#   which the subscriber should listen to.

#--- Unsubscribe
#
#   Unsubscribe to a channel
#
#   Give the 'pipe' that is listened to, e.g. 'my_channel_2'
#   and the channel 'my_channel' will be unsubscribed from
#   and the pipe 'my_channel_2' will no longer receive any
#   messages.
